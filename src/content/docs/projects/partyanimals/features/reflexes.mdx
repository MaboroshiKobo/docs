Pinatas are no longer just punching bags... they now have reflexes to help them survive longer! When hit, a pinata has a chance to trigger one of **six** new defensive moves:

1. **Shockwave** knocks nearby players away.
2. **Morph** temporarily turns the pinata into a baby (or resizes it).
3. **Blink** randomly teleports the pinata to a nearby location.
4. **Leap** launches the pinata high into the air.
5. **Sugar Rush** gives the pinata a burst of speed.
6. **Dazzle** blinds the attacker with potion effects.

Each reflex is highly configurable; you can define custom sound effects, particle effects, and even run commands whenever they trigger.
