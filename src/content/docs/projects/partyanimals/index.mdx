  <p>The modular player engagement and voting solution for Paper servers</p>
</div>

**PartyAnimals** is a modular **player engagement plugin** for **Paper** servers designed to reward your community through **voting** and interactive, **loot-filled Pinatas**. The purpose of the plugin is to boost engagement, reward voters, and automate excitement with community-driven events.

### Features

PartyAnimals handles player retention with a focus on these core functions:

* It spawns interactive **pinata** entities (can be any mob!) that players can strike to receive configurable rewards.
* You can configure their behaviors, allowing pinatas to roam, flee from players, or defend themselves with **reflexes** like *Shockwave* (knockback), *Blink* (teleportation), and more!
* It features a complete **voting module** that integrates with **NuVotifier** to track votes, handle offline queuing, and manage **community goals**.
* It includes extensive customization for rewards, messages, and interaction rules, with optional **PlaceholderAPI** support.

### Prerequisites

To use this plugin, your server must be running **Paper**, **Purpur**, or **Folia** on `1.21` or higher. It requires **Java 21** and the [NuVotifier](https://github.com/NuVotifier/NuVotifier) plugin to properly handle voting features.

#### Dependencies

Both dependencies are optional, but highly recommended:

* [NuVotifier](https://github.com/NuVotifier/NuVotifier)
* [PlaceholderAPI](https://placeholderapi.com/)
