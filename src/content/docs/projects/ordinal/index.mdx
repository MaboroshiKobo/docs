**Ordinal** is a lightweight **utility plugin** created to assign persistent, **sequential join IDs** (Ordinal Ranks) to every player on your server!

This plugin is ideal for servers wanting to have a **seniority system** to recognize long-time members, display distinct ranks in chat, or simply maintain an organized player database.

### Features

**Ordinal** provides a modern approach to **seniority tracking** with these core capabilities:
* **Sequential Seniority Ranks:** Assigns unique IDs (e.g., `#1`, `#67`) based on strict join order.
* **Smart Migration:** automatically calculates and backfills **seniority** for existing players based on historical join dates.
* **Native PlaceholderAPI support** to display **seniority ranks** in chat, tablists, and scoreboards using `%ordinal_rank%`.
* **Fully configurable messages** using [MiniMessage](https://docs.papermc.io/adventure/minimessage/format) formatting.
