  <h1>Junction</h1>
  <p>The modern Geyser & Floodgate management solution for Paper servers</p>
</div>

**Junction** is a high-performance **Floodgate addon** for **Paper** servers designed to automate **Bedrock Edition** player management. By detecting whether a player is using **Java or Bedrock**, Junction allows administrators to execute platform-specific commands and automate **LuckPerms** or **Vault** group assignments seamlessly.

### Features

Junction handles cross-platform management with a focus on these core functions:

* It provides automated group assignment using [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/), [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/), or [VaultUnlocked](https://modrinth.com/plugin/vaultunlocked) to put Bedrock players into specific permission groups upon join.
* You can configure edition-specific console commands that run separate logic for Java and Bedrock players during join and quit events.
* It includes extensive variable support using internal placeholders like `{player}` and `{uuid}`, with optional **PlaceholderAPI** support.

### Prerequisites

To use this plugin, your server must be running **Paper**, **Purpur**, or **Folia** on `1.21` or higher. It requires **Java 21** and the [Floodgate](https://geysermc.org/wiki/floodgate) plugin to properly detect player editions.
