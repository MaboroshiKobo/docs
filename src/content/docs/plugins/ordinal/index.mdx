title: Introduction

**Ordinal** is a lightweight **utility plugin** created to assign persistent, **sequential join IDs** (Ordinal Ranks) to every player on your server!

This plugin is ideal for servers looking to recognize **veteran players**, display distinct join ranks in chat, or simply maintain an organized player database with **minimal performance impact**.

> **This plugin might not assign join ranks accurately at times (especially noticeable when there were more than 1,000 players that had ever joined the server). Please report it if there were inconsistencies.**

### Features

**Ordinal** provides a modern approach to player tracking with these core capabilities:
* **Assign sequential IDs** (e.g., `#1`, `#67`) based on strict join order.
* **Smart migration system** that automatically calculates and backfills ranks for existing players based on historical join dates.
* **Native PlaceholderAPI support** to display ranks in chat, tablists, and scoreboards using `%ordinal_rank%`.
