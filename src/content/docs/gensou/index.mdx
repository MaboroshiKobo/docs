## Release Versioning

Gensou follows a structured versioning approach to help you understand what's changed between releases.

### Modpack Version Numbers

Each release uses this pattern: **Minecraft Version** + **Modpack Version**

- **Major** `?.x.x` - Significant changes like new mod additions or removals
- **Minor** `x.?.x` - Configuration updates, setting adjustments, or smaller mod changes  
- **Patch** `x.x.?` - Mod updates with minimal impact, bug fixes, or maintenance

Example Version Format: `1.21.11-1.0.0`

### New Minecraft Versions

When Minecraft updates (like `1.21.10` ➡ `1.21.11`), the modpack version resets to `1.0.0` to start fresh with the new base.
